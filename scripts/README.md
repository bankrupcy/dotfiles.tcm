# Scripts

Scripts that I use in the terminal. The others are just helpers for different applications.

- `cr` - compiles and runs cpp code
- `cp2cb` - copy code into clipboard to be pasted
- `mbcp` - mainly used to stress test cpp code for competitive programming
- `mdbg` - scrapes [mdbg.net](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary) for strokes and moves them into my anki assets
